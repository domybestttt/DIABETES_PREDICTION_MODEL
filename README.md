# DIABETES_PREDICTION_MODEL

I've built this model using Pima Indian Dataset. 
I've performed data preprocessing such as assigning median values to columns like BMI,Glucose,Skin Thickness,etc. as realistically it's impossible.
The model is built based on SVM model. 
The kernels used here is 'rbf','linear' and 'poly' kernel.  
The classifier used is XGBClassifier with a learning rate is 0.1. 
I've hosted it on Streamlit.
